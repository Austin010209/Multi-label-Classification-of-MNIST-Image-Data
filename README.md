# Multi-label-Classification-of-MNIST-Image-Data
This project is a convolutional Neural Network model(written in Keras) to classify image data from a modified MNIST dataset, which contains images of 1 to 5 digits. After using data augmentation and bootstrap. Using the model, a 99.714% accuracy was achieved based on the test results from Kaggle.
